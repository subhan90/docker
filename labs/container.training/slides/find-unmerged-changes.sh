# The materials for a given training live in their own branch.
# Sometimes, we write custom content (or simply new content) for a training,
# and that content doesn't get merged back to main. This script tries to
# detect that with the following heuristics:
# - list all remote branches
# - for each remote branch, list the changes that weren't merged into main
#   (using "diff main...$BRANCH", three dots)
# - ignore a bunch of training-specific files that change all the time anyway
# - for the remaining files, compute the diff between main and the branch
#   (using "diff main..$BRANCH", two dots)
# - ignore changes of less than 10 lines
# - also ignore a few red herrings
# - display whatever is left

# For "git diff" (in the filter function) to work correctly, we must be
# at the root of the repo.
