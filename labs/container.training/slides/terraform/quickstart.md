## Quick start

- We're going to use Terraform to deploy a basic Kubernetes cluster

- We will need cloud credentials (make sure you have a valid cloud account!)

---

## Steps

1. Install Terraform (download single Go binary)

2. Configure credentials (e.g. `gcloud auth login`)

3. Create Terraform *configuration*

4. Add *providers* to the configuration

5. Initialize providers with `terraform init`

6. Add *resources* to the configuration

7. Realize the resources with `terraform apply`

8. Repeat 6-7 or 4-5-6-7
