## Exercise â€” Sealed Secrets

- Install the sealed secrets operator

- Create a secret, seal it, load it in the cluster

- Check that sealed secrets are "locked"

  (can't be used with a different name, namespace, or cluster)

- Bonus: migrate a sealing key to another cluster

- Set RBAC permissions to grant selective access to secrets
