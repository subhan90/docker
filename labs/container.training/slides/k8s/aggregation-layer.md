# The Aggregation Layer

- The aggregation layer is a way to extend the Kubernetes API

- It is similar to CRDs

  - it lets us define new resource types

  - these resources can then be used with `kubectl` and other clients

- The implementation is very different

  - CRDs are handled within the API server

  - the aggregation layer offloads requests to another process

- They are designed for very different use-cases

---

## CRDs vs aggregation layer

- The Kubernetes API is a REST-ish API with a hierarchical structure

- It can be extended with Custom Resource Definifions (CRDs)

- Custom resources are managed by the Kubernetes API server

  - we don't need to write code

  - the API server does all the heavy lifting

  - these resources are persisted in Kubernetes' "standard" database
    <br/>
    (for most installations, that's `etcd`)

- We can also define resources that are *not* managed by the API server

  (the API server merely proxies the requests to another server)

---

## Which one is best?

- For things that "map" well to objects stored in a traditional database:

  *probably CRDs*

- For things that "exist" only in Kubernetes and don't represent external resources:

  *probably CRDs*

- For things that are read-only, at least from Kubernetes' perspective:

  *probably aggregation layer*

- For things that can't be stored in etcd because of size or access patterns:

  *probably aggregation layer*

---

## How are resources organized?

- Let's have a look at the Kubernetes API hierarchical structure

- We'll ask `kubectl` to show us the exacts requests that it's making

.lab[

- Check the URI for a cluster-scope, "core" resource, e.g. a Node:
  ```bash
  kubectl -v6 get node node1
  ```

- Check the URI for a cluster-scope, "non-core" resource, e.g. a ClusterRole:
  ```bash
  kubectl -v6 get clusterrole view
  ```

]

---

## Core vs non-core

- This is the structure of the URIs that we just checked:

  ```
    /api/v1/nodes/node1
         â†‘    â†‘     â†‘
     `version` `kind` `name`

    /apis/rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterroles/view
                        â†‘           â†‘        â†‘       â†‘
                      `group`      `version`   `kind`    `name`
  ```

- There is no group for "core" resources

- Or, we could say that the group, `core`, is implied

---

## Group-Version-Kind

- In the API server, the Group-Version-Kind triple maps to a Go type

  (look for all the "GVK" occurrences in the source code!)

- In the API server URI router, the GVK is parsed "relatively early"

  (so that the server can know which resource we're talking about)

- "Well, actually ..." Things are a bit more complicated, see next slides!

## Namespaced resources

- What about namespaced resources?

.lab[

- Check the URI for a namespaced, "core" resource, e.g. a Service:
  ```bash
  kubectl -v6 get service kubernetes --namespace default
  ```

]

- Here are what namespaced resources URIs look like:

  ```
    /api/v1/namespaces/default/services/kubernetes
         â†‘               â†‘        â†‘         â†‘
      `version`        `namespace`  `kind`      `name`

    /apis/apps/v1/namespaces/kube-system/daemonsets/kube-proxy
           â†‘   â†‘                 â†‘           â†‘          â†‘
       `group`  `version`        `namespace`     `kind`       `name`
  ```

---

## Subresources

- Many resources have *subresources*, for instance:

  - `/status` (decouples status updates from other updates)

  - `/scale` (exposes a consistent interface for autoscalers)

  - `/proxy` (allows access to HTTP resources)

  - `/portforward` (used by `kubectl port-forward`)

  - `/logs` (access pod logs)

- These are added at the end of the URI

---

class: extra-details

## Accessing a subresource

.lab[

- List `kube-proxy` pods:
  ```bash
    kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system --selector=k8s-app=kube-proxy
    PODNAME=$(
      kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system --selector=k8s-app=kube-proxy \
              -o json | jq -r .items[0].metadata.name)
  ```

- Execute a command in a pod, showing the API requests:
  ```bash
  kubectl -v6 exec --namespace=kube-system $PODNAME -- echo hello world
  ```

]

--

The full request looks like:
```
POST https://.../api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/pods/kube-proxy-c7rlw/exec?
command=echo&command=hello&command=world&container=kube-proxy&stderr=true&stdout=true
```

---

## Listing what's supported on the server

- There are at least three useful commands to introspect the API server

.lab[

- List resources types, their group, kind, short names, and scope:
  ```bash
  kubectl api-resources
  ```

- List API groups + versions:
  ```bash
  kubectl api-versions
  ```

- List APIServices:
  ```bash
  kubectl get apiservices
  ```

]

--

ðŸ¤” What's the difference between the last two?

---

## API registration

- `kubectl api-versions` shows all API groups, including `apiregistration.k8s.io`

- `kubectl get apiservices` shows the "routing table" for API requests

- The latter doesn't show `apiregistration.k8s.io`

  (APIServices belong to `apiregistration.k8s.io`)

- Most API groups are `Local` (handled internally by the API server)

- If we're running the `metrics-server`, it should handle `metrics.k8s.io`

- This is an API group handled *outside* of the API server

- This is the *aggregation layer!*

---

## Finding resources

The following assumes that `metrics-server` is deployed on your cluster.

.lab[

- Check that the metrics.k8s.io is registered with `metrics-server`:
  ```bash
  kubectl get apiservices | grep metrics.k8s.io
  ```

- Check the resource kinds registered in the metrics.k8s.io group:
  ```bash
  kubectl api-resources --api-group=metrics.k8s.io
  ```

]

(If the output of either command is empty, install `metrics-server` first.)

---

## `nodes` vs `nodes`

- We can have multiple resources with the same name

.lab[

- Look for resources named `node`:
  ```bash
  kubectl api-resources | grep -w nodes
  ```

- Compare the output of both commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get nodes.metrics.k8s.io
  ```

]

--

ðŸ¤” What are the second kind of nodes? How can we see what's really in them?

---

## Node vs NodeMetrics

- `nodes.metrics.k8s.io` (aka NodeMetrics) don't have fancy *printer columns*

- But we can look at the raw data (with `-o json` or `-o yaml`)

.lab[

- Look at NodeMetrics objects with one of these commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get -o yaml nodes.metrics.k8s.io
  kubectl get -o yaml NodeMetrics
  ```

]

--

ðŸ’¡ Alright, these are the live metrics (CPU, RAM) for our nodes.

---

## An easier way to consume metrics

- We might have seen these metrics before ... With an easier command!

--

.lab[

- Display node metrics:
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes
  ```

- Check which API requests happen behind the scenes:
  ```bash
  kubectl top nodes -v6
  ```

]

---

## Aggregation layer in practice

- We can write an API server to handle a subset of the Kubernetes API

- Then we can register that server by creating an APIService resource

.lab[

- Check the definition used for the `metrics-server`:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe apiservices v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io
  ```
]

- Group priority is used when multiple API groups provide similar kinds

  (e.g. `nodes` and `nodes.metrics.k8s.io` as seen earlier)

---

## Authentication flow

- We have two Kubernetes API servers:
 
  - "aggregator" (the main one; clients connect to it)

  - "aggregated" (the one providing the extra API; aggregator connects to it)

- Aggregator deals with client authentication

- Aggregator authenticates with aggregated using mutual TLS

- Aggregator passes (/forwards/proxies/...) requests to aggregated

- Aggregated performs authorization by calling back aggregator

  ("can subject X perform action Y on resource Z?")

[This doc page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-aggregation-layer/#authentication-flow) has very nice swim lanes showing that flow.

---

## Discussion

- Aggregation layer is great for metrics

  (fast-changing, ephemeral data, that would be outrageously bad for etcd)

- It *could* be a good fit to expose other REST APIs as a pass-thru 

  (but it's more common to see CRDs instead)
