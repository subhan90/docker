                This application is a simple Node.js application that is expected to run in a
                container deployed by OpenShift. It was created to help explore OpenShift
                by allowing the user to write messages to the log, crash the application, and even
                create and view files on a persistent filesystem.

                This project is based on a similar project by IBM,

                This app uses <a href="https://www.patternfly.org/" target="_blank">
                    PatternFly <span class="fa fa-external-link-alt small"></span>
                </a>, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/" target="_blank">

                </a>, and some custom styling. All the files have been copied locally
                to this application so Internet connectivity is not required and can work in an air-gapped system.
