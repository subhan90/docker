# Custom Scheduler
- Official docs: [Scheduler Configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/scheduling/config)
- In this lab we will write our own pods scheduler.
- It not something that you will even need to do, but still its a good practice
- To schedule a given pod using a specific scheduler, specify the name of the scheduler in that specification `.spec.schedulerName`.
## A bit about scheduler
- Scheduling happens in a series of **stages* that are exposed through extension points.
- We can define several scheduling Profile. A scheduling Profile allows you to configure the different stages of scheduling in the `kube-scheduler`

## Sample `KubeSchedulerConfiguration`
```yaml
###
# Sample KubeSchedulerConfiguration
###
#
# You can configure `kube-scheduler` to run more than one profile. 
# Each profile has an associated scheduler name and can have a different 
#    set of plugins configured in its extension points.

# With the following sample configuration, 
# the scheduler will run with two profiles: 
# - default plugins 
# - all scoring plugins disabled.

apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration
profiles:
  - schedulerName: default-scheduler
  - schedulerName: no-scoring-scheduler
    plugins:
      preScore:
        disabled:
        - name: '*'
      score:
        disabled:
        - name: '*'
```
- Once you have your scheduler code you can use it in your pod scheduler 
```yaml
# In this sample we use deployment but it will apply to any pod
...
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
    spec:
      # This is the import part of this file.
      # Here we define our custom scheduler
      schedulerName: CodeWizardScheduler # <------
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx

```

### Sample bash scheduler.
- The "trick" is loop over all the waiting pods and search for the custom scheduler match in `spec.schedulerName` 
```sh

...
  # Get a list of all our pods in pending state
  for POD in $(kubectl  get pods \
                        --server ${CLUSTER_URL} \
                        --all-namespaces \
                        --output jsonpath='{.items..metadata.name}' \
                        --field-selector=status.phase==Pending); 
    do

    # Get the desired schedulerName if th epod has defined any schedulerName
    CUSTOM_SCHEDULER_NAME=$(kubectl get pod ${POD} \
                                    --output jsonpath='{.spec.schedulerName}')

    # Check if the desired schedulerName is our custome one
    # If its a match this is where our custom scheduler will "jump in"
    if [ "${CUSTOM_SCHEDULER_NAME}" == "${CUSTOM_SCHEDULER}" ]; 
      then
        # Do your magic here ......
        # Schedule the PODS as you wish
    fi
    ...
```
