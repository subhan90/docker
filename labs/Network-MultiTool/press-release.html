<h1>05 Jan 2022 - Press-release: `Praqma/Network-Multitool` is now `wbitt/Network-Multitool`</h1>

<h2>Important note about name/org change:</h2>
<p>
Few years ago, I created this tool with Henrik HÃ¸egh, as `praqma/network-multitool`. Praqma was bought by another company, and now the "Praqma" brand is being dismantled. This means the network-multitool's git and docker repositories must go. Since, I was the one maintaining the docker image for all these years, it was decided by the current representatives of the company to hand it over to me so I can continue maintaining it. So, apart from a small change in the repository name, nothing has changed.<br>
</p>
<p>
The existing/old/previous container image `praqma/network-multitool` will continue to work and will remain available for **"some time"** - may be for a couple of months - not sure though.
